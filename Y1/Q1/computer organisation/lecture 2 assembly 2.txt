calling convention

6 registers are used for params (linux)
	rdi
	rsi
	rdx
	rcx	
	r8	
	r9
	rest is pushed to stack
callie: 
	1. push return address
	2. push stack base pointer
	3. move current stackpointer to base pointer
	4. convention is to then subtract from stack pointer to make space for local variables so they are always the same dist from the base pointer
	5. do function
	6. move stack pointer back
	7. pop base pointer
	8. pop return address

	return variables are usually in RAX/EAX
	15 bytes is max instruction set (includes instruction params)
