## exercises
### 1 
$f: \mathbb Q \to \mathbb Z$, with $f(x) = \sqrt{x^2}$ show the following function is not well-defined
you cannot grantee it's a integer, give a counter example like 0.5    
well defined functions need:
- $\forall x \in \mathbb Q \space f(x) \in \mathbb Z$
- every $x \in \mathbb Q$ maps to exactly one value in $\mathbb Z$

$\sqrt 49 = 7 | \sqrt 49 \ne -7$
### 2
$g: \mathbb N \to \mathbb Z$ such that $g(x) = x^2 + 3$ surjective or injective
- surjective means for every valid output there's a valid input
- injective means y values are unique
- bijective?
### 3
"can a function be an equivalance relation?"   
any boolean function? like a predicate? nope: f(x) = x
equivalance means:
- reflexive
- symetic
- transitive
### 4
is {(0,1), (1,2), (1,3)} is this thing a relation or a function?   
it's a relation because it's a set of tuple, probably   
not a function because x=1 has 2 y values   
cannot check if {(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)} is a function because every value in the domain should map to a value in the co-domain, without a domain, we can't check
### 5
injective $f: A \to B$   
$|B| \geq |A|$ (notation only for finite sets)   
surjective $f: A \to B$   
$|B| \leq |A|$
because for everything in B there must be something in A   
bijective $f: A \to B$   
$|B|=|A|$
### 6
$\mathbb N$ en {$x \in \mathbb N: x$ even} which is bigger?


## infinities
f(n) = 2n is a bijection, so n and f(n) have the same size  
$f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb Z$ f(n): all even numbers map to the positve numbers, all odd ones to the negative numbers   
countable infinities: listable, i can make a pattern and predict every value of set B based on A, thereby proving i can map N to that set   
uncountable infinity: make an infinite list with every irrational number, you missed one: take the first digit of the first number, add one, second digit from the second number, add 1 etc, it will be different from every single number, it must be.   
$|\mathbb N| = \infin$ but $|\mathbb N| < |S|$
