   - campus card or ID card (my.tudelft app not enough)
   - snacks and drinks, no sounds or smells
   - hall 3 in X

   - for some courses you get to take the questions home


### proofs:
- proof by contradiction
   - try contradicting in, show that does not work
- proof by contrapositive
- proof by division into cases
   

### something else
   - even is 2n
   - odd is 2n+1
   - proof should be story
   - stories need endings
   - you get a point for just writing the ending to the story
   - 0 is even because 0*0 is 0
