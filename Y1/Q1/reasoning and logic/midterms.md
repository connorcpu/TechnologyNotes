   - quantifiers
propositional
   - $\neg q \to \neg p$ is the contrapositive of $p \to q$ (LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT)
   - $q \to p$ is the converse of $p \to q$
   - $\neg p \to \neg q$ is the inverse of $p \to q$
   - demorgans (destributive but for negations) $\neg(p \land q) \equiv (\neg p) \lor (\neg q)$ (switch land and lor and destribute the neg)
   - destributive: $p \land (q \lor r) \equiv (p \land q) \lor (p \land r)$
   - misc
terms
   - definition: you get to assume it's true
   - theorem: if you say it's true you have to prove it
   - conjecture: a theorem we believe to be true but cannot prove or disprove (yet)
proofs
   - induction
      - prove base case (usually n=1)
      - assume inductive hypothosis 
      - building on inductive hypothosis (p(k) NOT $p(k)\to p(k+1)$), prove p(k+1)
   - diffrent proof types
      - induction 
         - proof by invariant:
            - invariant is a statement that is true after an iteration if it is true before as well
            - step 1. initalize base case, prove invariant holds in the base case which is before the first iteration
            - step 2. prove if the invariant holds before the iteration it also holds after.
            - step 3. prove the loop must at some point end 
            - step 4. combine invariant and negation of ending condition (guard) into a statement which you were actually trying to prove
      - exhaustion (into cases): divide into cases prove that each case seperatly holds
      - contradiction: prove the oposite cannot possible be true
      - generalization: make use of an arbitrairy which represents the entire domain
      - contraposition: prove the contrapositive, which by virtue of being logically equivalent proves the origional proposition
   - recursion


## notes 
- your proof is a story, a story needs an ending 
- points for only writing the end of the story
- 0 is even
- bring pen (or pencil)
- campus card (or ID but bring both)
- snacks and drinks are allowed but no sounds or smells
- hall 3 in X
- 9:00
- for some courses you get to take the questions home
- learn karnau-maps
- FILE IS UNFINISHED, CONSULT:
   - brightspace slides
   - check old tests
   - book
   - skill circuit


## test checkings:
1. learn what fucking sufficient means ya idiot
2. learn what a formal definition is (tarski's world) and USE THAT WHEN THEY ASK FOR IT
3. BRUH, counter examples need you to have both examples true :facepalm:
4. don't forget domain
5. learn to use arbitrairy shit
6. while you're at it, formal proofs
7. revisit 5B
8. tree nodes are their own decendents ASNCOHSNAHOUSNAOHEUCEAOUHEOUHC
