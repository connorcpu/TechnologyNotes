interactive lectures tuesday and thursday (BRING PEN AND PAPER)
wednesday and friday labs
thursday acing R&L sessions: big questions, 1 hour with TA's for more open-ended questions
7 TA-checks (roughly weekly), not-mandatory but recommended, at exam level
	roughly 1-4 hours of works
	3-5 ppl per group
	groups are predetermened and in brightspace
	deadlines always saturday 23:59
	best way to prep exam
	lootboxes if you do them
programming project from week 3
formative midterm (not for final grade but bonus points
A SINGLE FINAL EXAM, endterm

5.8 as passing grade, 1<F<10
midterm and project are bonus
b = min(10, max(0,2 * [M-5])+max(0.2*[p-5]))
x=F+(B*(10-F)/100)

only start getting points if you get a passing grade (rounded to half integers)
both contribute to the same pool but theres a max you can get in just the midterms
bonus points scale down the higher you score
above 8 is considered great (cough parents)
retakes can't lower your grade
programming project is in fucked up language
3 hour exams

last year's slides are on brightspace
new slides available after lecture

skill circuit, everything you need to know but in tech-tree format
	also shows what you need to know before lecture
	brightspace also has it
	quadruple quest (4 courses, 2 years) and saucy secrets are skill circuit exclusive
