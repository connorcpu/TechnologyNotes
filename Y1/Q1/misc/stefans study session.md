thinking fast and slow by daniel kahneman
   - 2 systems, gut that's just done and contiece


dunning-kruger goes 2 ways
passed ppl underestimate 80% of the time 
failed ppl overestimate 50% of the timeo


in stephans case, sleep, food and placement is more relavent on if he can focus than what the task is
find the adhd study workshops, in brightspace after lecture, gezondeboel might have some stuff
sleeping before exams, recommended to atleast try but he's basing it on nerves
plan the next study session, **WRITE DOWN WHAT TO START THE NEXT SESSION WITH**


## study activities 
something you can do in 20-30 minutes, revise or study new stuff
- cornell note-taking
   - note are not for reference, they are for remembering
   - summaries are good to _make_ not to read them
   - 1. split page into 3 parts
   - 2. two columns, one box at the bottom
   - 3. one column is notes as you currently take them 
   - 4. other column are queues, they are keywords or questions about the notes
   - 5. at the bottom, 2-3 line summary of the whole thing 
   - 6. cover the notes, based on the queues, reproduce the notes, prefarably by saying it out loud
   - 7. difficulty is important, otherwise you are not doing much
   - alternatively, write down 2 questions about the lecture, if you can awnser them why reference the slides
      - on induction: what is the template of a proof by induction (example)
- fynemen technique
   - "explain it like i'm 5"
   - "peer review the work of your colleagues"
   - "discuss the work you did with the other team"
   - forces you to explain something out loud, in an organized way (like rubber ducky debugging)
   - try the 1-syllable words thing
- revision is very very different from learning, only revisit lectures etc if you have proof you need it
- stratagy: "in, out, out, out"


## study stratagies
how to apply activities over the long term
- make a plan (possible to deviate, include 20% margin)
- take a table for the week, put in all the weekly things 
- put in schedualed things 
- where to put the rest of the hours
- REMEMBER TO PUT IN THE FUN STUFF
- keep some time open for unexpected stuff (20%)
- talk to someone about your plan, atleast voice your plans, this makes it more likely to stick

## study habits 
- study environment
   - most ppl have a specific place to study in (challange, try studying in a different place, library)
      - it's to easy to get destracted at home because it's associated with a lot of activities 
      - campus is better but other ppl and travel time
   - associate places with activities like going to the library to read a book

# sleep 
- you forget a lot by sleeping less 
- sleep is a matter of routine so train it
- sleep quality / sleep hygine
   - take your phone to it
   - read a couple pages of a book
   - train that after a certain activity, sleep follows
