- R&L
   - how to write proofs
   - check if i have all the material
   - practice exam
      - start with some basic propositional stuff
      - some slightly more complex predicate stuff with tarski's worlds
         - formal structures define predicates as a set of tuples for which they are tru<Up>
      - structural induction proof
      - invarient puzzle
      - recursive sets
      - set theory
      - trees
      - (directed) graphs
      - infinities (to prove countable, maps an index in $\N$ to every option 
      - look at:
         - 8B
         - 10.{A,B}
         - which one is injection vs surjective 
- CO 
   - check if i have all the material
   - check self study answers
   - practice exams 
- IP
   - learn javadoc
      - /** to start, * on every line, */ to end
      - start with a description (just write it no need to be weird)
      - then block tags such as @param and @return
   - learn unit testing
      - use @Test 
      - use assertEquals to check if 2 objects or values are equal, uses object 1's equals method 
      - assertNotEquals, assertFalse, assertNull, just check the junit javadoc
   - learn functional
      - 
   - look at other I/O things
   - learn equals methods
      - default equals looks at memory addresses
      - don't use instanceof as it is not symetric 
      1. check if (o == this)
      2. checkf if (o != null and this.getClass == o.getClass)
      3. cast object to the current class, call objects.equals(this.var1, that.var1) (compare all vars using Objects.equals)
      4. super.equals?
   - practice (array lengths) (abstract classes)
